                        While I was working on <a class="link" href="omnicell.html">Benchmarking at Omnicell</a>, I also took on another project called Scorecards. Scorecards is another aspect of Inventory Optimization Services (IOS) that was in the same vertical as Benchmarking, but measures KPIs such as Total Valuation, Total Savings, and Total Purchases instead of Shortages or Overrides. The primary ask was to bring Scorecards up to date with the latest visuals within the design system, however it soon became apparent that some major changes besides updating to the latest visuals and design system patterns needed to be made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I first started off by doing a heuristic analysis of Scorecards. Three violations immediately stood out to me:
                    </p>
                    <content>
                        <p>
                            <ul class="is-size-6-touch is-size-5-desktop">
                                <li><strong>Aesthetic & Design:</strong> Both systems had major design viulations. Some pages would have an almost overwhelming amount of information that would force a user with a smaller screen to scroll horizontally, while other pages would be almost empty, if not empty. One system hid relevant information behind a dropdown menu which would then open in tabs at the bottom of the page.</li>
                                <li><strong>Visibility Of System Status:</strong> Pages with data have mysteriously empty fields with no indication as to whether they were optional or not.</li>
                                <li><strong>Help & Documentation:</strong> There were active buttons that upon being clicked would seemingly do nothing, and when I inquired about them I was told that they would only generate an outcome if certain prerequisites had been met. Said prerequisites were never mentioned anywhere in the system.</li>
                                <li><strong>Flexibility & Efficiency of Use:</strong> The information architecture in both systems was subpar, and accessing key information was especially hard in the second one.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        After performing the heuristic analysis and taking notes, I then set up time with subject matter experts to get their feedback on the existing Scorecards application. Their feedback was mostly centered around elements that we could remove, existing issues,and adding additional KPIs in the future. As we only had enough developer bandwidth to remake the screens, I made a list of items that they wanted to see in the future, and another list composed of elements we could remove and fixing existing issues. I then took screenshots of the existing pages within scorecards and began marking them up based on the heuristic analysis and the feedback from the strategists.

                        After designing the initial screens, I went through an ideation and prototyping cycle. Initial feedback was positive, however one subject matter experts felt strongly that the inventory value over time graph could be moved to the metrics page. When asked about this, other SMEs didn’t have any strong feelings one way or another, however when brought to the larger bi-weekly meeting of SMEs others agreed, so I moved it to the metrics page. There was some initial concern that there was too much information on the metrics page, however after talking with SMEs they thought that it was just enough information on the page and we could go forward with the page as I had it.

                        While working with the subject matter experts was fairly painless, other challenges arose in their place. The main challenge was working with a PM who felt that they had the knowledge to push back on UX decisions when they really didn’t. Multiple times I thought we had agreement on what we were going to go forward with, only to join a review and be asked if we could change the designs. This kept happening despite conversations that I had with their boss, and conversations that my boss had with both the PM and their boss. This culminated when the we (PM, engineers, and myself) all agreed that we would go forward with one idea, and the PM purposely wrote up a JIRA ticket that said we decided to go forward with her idea. After this, I told the engineers that if they had any questions over whether a JIRA ticket was right, they should come to me rather than the PM. If I had to revisit this experience, I would've gone to both my boss and the PMs boss sooner than I did in order to stop this behavior.

                        While the PM was the biggest issue on the product, there were also some database challenges that popped up. The largest issue was that our data wasn’t as granular across the various scorecards as we thought. For the data in Medication Visibility, we weren’t able to filter by date at all, so we had to remove the date picker. For the data in Pharmacy Metrics, we had to modify the datepicker time selections in order to match the options with the data which could only be filtered down to the month level instead of to the day.

                        Overall, I'm happy with how the project turned out. While there were the dual issues of the PM and incomplete data, this was a good learning experience overall in terms of how to deal with unexpected roadblocks. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to measure KPIs such as task success rate and time to complete tasks as myself and most of the design team were let go before the product could be released.
